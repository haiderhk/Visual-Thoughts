Visual Thoughts puts personalization at the forefront of your journaling experience. Craft your unique journaling style by selecting from various writing tones (formal to casual), focus areas (personal growth, mindfulness, achievements), and formatting preferences (structured paragraphs or bullet points). Make your entries location-smart by saving frequent spots as personalized labels like 'Home' or 'Office', adding meaningful context to each entry. These customization options work seamlessly with our AI to generate journal entries that authentically capture your voice, style, and daily experiences.
